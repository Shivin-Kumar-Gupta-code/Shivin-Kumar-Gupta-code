## 🧩 About Me

I am a **backend-first full-stack developer** with an **Electronics and Communication Engineering** background.  
My engineering mindset drives me to understand **how systems work internally**, not just how to use tools or frameworks.

I don’t chase shortcuts or trends. Instead, I focus on **clarity, consistency, and production-style coding practices** — learning deeply, building patiently, and improving incrementally with every project.

I believe **great engineers are shaped over time** by:
- strong fundamentals  
- clean and scalable architecture  
- real-world problem solving  
- discipline, patience, and consistency

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

> *“If you can’t explain how it works internally, you don’t fully understand it.”*

- Backend-first thinking, even for full-stack applications  
- Simplicity over unnecessary abstraction  
- Code should be **readable before it is clever**  
- Systems should be **scalable before they are fancy**  
- Long-term growth always beats short-term hype
